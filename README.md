# Open Parties and Claims

This Minecraft mod adds the ability to claim and to forceload world chunks, as well as create and manage player parties. It also gives server 
owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.

The mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side.

The mod is currently in beta. 

# Dependencies

When using Fabric or Quilt, this mod depends on the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) (or the [Quilted Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qsl)) and the [Forge Config API Port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric).

# User Guide

## Playing

Get this mod from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-parties-and-claims). 
It is also recommended to get the Xaero's [Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap) and 
the [World Map](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map) mods, which implement this mod's API. 
Install this mod how you normally would a Forge/Fabric mod. There are plenty of tutorials online, if you're new.

## Developing

_The license that this mod is released under, as I understand it, explicitly allows you have this mod as a dependency for your own mod and 
use the API through Java/JVM mechanics, under some conditions in some cases, mostly when embedding the mod in yours. That is why I chose it. 
It is very similar to what Minecraft Forge is currently released under. This paragraph is not a legal statement or legal advice. Make sure to 
get familiar with the actual license terms on your own._

Add this project as a dependency to your build.gradle, for example with [CurseMaven](https://www.cursemaven.com/) or manually 
download a jar file from CurseForge and use a flatDir repository. 
Build the mod jar from the source code yourself if you so prefer.

I strongly recommend that you use the [javadoc](https://thexaero.github.io/open-parties-and-claims/javadoc) for reference when working with the API. 
Locate either or both of the following 2 main API classes in the javadoc and you should be good to go from there:

`xaero.pac.client.api.OpenPACClientAPI`

`xaero.pac.common.server.api.OpenPACServerAPI`

# Contributions

I do not accept pull-requests at the moment, in case I decide to release this mod under a different license in the near future. 
Contributions from other people might cause complications.
